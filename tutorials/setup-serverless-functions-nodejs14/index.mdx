## Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn how to setup your local dev environment, create your first Serverless Function that will query a mySQL DB, test it locally and finally deploy it.

To achieve this, we use a [Serverless Function](https://www.scaleway.com/en/serverless-functions/) and the following elements:
- The [Serverless.com framework](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/functions/api-cli/fun-uploading-with-serverless-framework/)
- The [Boilerplate in NodeJS](https://github.com/Sebastien-Meiffren/scaleway-serveless-nodejs)

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- You have created a [Serverless Functions namespace](/compute/functions/how-to/create-a-functions-namespace/)
- You have NodeJS14 installed on your local computer
- You have a mySQL DB available somewhere to query it
- You have installed the [Serverless.com cli](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/functions/api-cli/fun-uploading-with-serverless-framework/)
- You have cloned the [Boilerplate in NodeJS](https://github.com/Sebastien-Meiffren/scaleway-serveless-nodejs)

</Message>

## Setup

1. Clone the boilerplate

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Sebastien-Meiffren/scaleway-serveless-nodejs.git
cd scaleway-serveless-nodejs
```

2. Install all needed packages

```bash
npm install
```

3. Make sure that everything is OK

```bash
npm run build && npm run start
curl 'http://localhost:8081?handlerName=foohandle&handlerPath=../handlers/src/foo'
```

You should see ``OK`` displayed in your console.

<Message type="warning">
    Once a function has been executed, it will always be used by the instance UNTIL you stop and start the process.

## First function

<Message type="requirement">
    You are located at the root directory of the boilerplate
</Message>

1. To query a mySQL DB, we need the ``mysql2`` package from NPM.

```bash
npm install mysql2
```

4. Create the file that will contain your Serverless Function. We will call it ``insertdb.js``

```bash
cd handlers
touch insertdb.js
```

```javascript
const https = require('https');
module.exports.insertDb = async function(event, context, callback) {
    if(event.httpMethod === "POST") {
        try {
            // need to whitelist the IP
            let connection = await require('mysql2/promise').createConnection({
                host: process.env.DB_URL,
                user: process.env.DB_USER,
                password: process.env.DB_PASS,
                database: process.env.DB_NAME,
                port: process.env.DB_PORT
            });

            const data = new URLSearchParams(event.body);
            const date = new Date();

            await connection.query("INSERT INTO `user` (`id`, `name`, `email`, `date`) VALUES (null, ?, ?, ?)", [data.get("name"), data.get("email"), date], function (error, results, fields) {
                if (error) throw error;
            })

            connection.end()
            return {
                body: JSON.stringify({status: "OK"}),
                statusCode: 200
            }
        } catch(e) {
            console.log("ERROR", e)
            return {
                statusCode: 500,
                body: e.name + " - " + e.message
            }
        }
    } else {
        return {
            statusCode: 500
        }
    }
}
```

## Test locally

<Message type="requirement">
    You are located at the root directory of the boilerplate
</Message>


1. Edit your package.json to add your environment variables, at the ``start`` script

```
"start": "NODE_ENV=production DB_URL= DB_USER= DB_PASS= DB_NAME= DB_PORT=3306 node ./dist/index.js"
```

2. Start your process

```bash
npm start
```

3. Call your function

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8081?handlerName=insertDb&handlerPath=../handlers/src/insertdb&name=test&email=test@test.com'
```

You should see ``{status: "OK"}`` displaied in your console


## Deploy

<Message type="requirement">
    You are located at the root directory of the boilerplate
</Message>

1. Configure your `handlers\serverless.conf` conf file by replacing the missing values (NAMESPACE_NAME_IN_SCALEWAY + TOKEN_FROM_YOUR_API + ID_OF_YOUR_PROJECT)

```yaml
service: <NAMESPACE_NAME_IN_SCALEWAY>
configValidationMode: off
provider:
  name: scaleway
  runtime: node14
  # Global Environment variables - used in every functions
  env:
    test: test
  # the path to the credentials file needs to be absolute
  scwToken: <TOKEN_FROM_YOUR_API>
  scwProject: <ID_OF_YOUR_PROJECT>

plugins:
  - serverless-scaleway-functions

package:
  patterns:
    - '!.gitignore'
    - '!.git/**'
    - './src/**'
    - './node_modules/**'

functions:
  name_of_your_first_function:
    handler: src/insertdb.insertDb
    # Local environment variables - used only in given function
    env:
      DB_URL: test
      DB_USER: test
      DB_PASS: test
      DB_NAME: test
      DB_PORT: test
```

2. You need to install your packages in the ``handlers\package.json`` files. This is done this way, to avoid uploading many node_modules not needed for your script BUT only needed to run your code locally. With our example, we need to "reinstall" ``mysql2``. There is also a module that needs to be installed to make the Serverless.com cli work properly.

```bash
cd handlers
npm install mysql2
npm install
```

3. Deploy your code

```bash
serverless deploy
```

Note that a .dist directory will be created with a zip file with all your files uploaded to Scaleway
