Each container comes with an autogenerated domain on which it is available. However it is possible to use your own domain name to address your containers to facilitate the use of them.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- A running Serverless container
- A domain name 

</Message>

1. Add a CNAME pointing to your Function/Container default url from the [domains dashboard](/network/dns-cloud/how-to/manage-dns-records/).
2. On your function page go to the Endpoints tab.

3. Click on **+ Add a New Endpoint**.
4. Write down your custom URL and validate the form.
5. Once the CNAME and TLS fields are checked you can connect to your container using your custom domain.
