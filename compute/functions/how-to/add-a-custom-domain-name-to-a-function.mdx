Each function comes with an automatically generated domain on which it is available. However it is possible to use your own domain name to address your functions to facilitate the use of them.

<Message type="requirement">

- You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
- A running Serverless function
- A domain name 

</Message>

1. Add a CNAME pointing to your function default URL from the [domains dashboard](/network/dns-cloud/how-to/manage-dns-records/).
2. Click the **Endpoints** tab on your Functions' page.

3. Click **+ Add a New Endpoint**.
4. Write down your custom URL and validate the form.

Once the CNAME and TLS fields are validated you can connect to your function using your custom domain.
